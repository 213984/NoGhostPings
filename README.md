#### What is NoGhostPings?
This is a bot - written in JavaScript using the discord api wrapper discord.js - which is usually running as a selfbot.
It will log discord mentions - depending on how you set the json file - either in console or in a file (or both?).
You can decide what to log between:
- Ghost mentions (mention delete)
- Softghost mention (mention + edit message)
- Normal mention (normal mention)
