# NoGhostPings

### I will no longer write code for this project.

#### What is NoGhostPings?
This is a bot - written in JavaScript using the discord api wrapper discord.js - which is usually running as a selfbot.
It will log discord mentions - depending on how you set the json file - either in console or in a file (or both?).
You can decide what to log between:
- Ghost mentions (mention delete)
- Softghost mention (mention + edit message)
- Normal mention (normal mention)

#### How to use
In order to use this effective you need some JS(ON) knowledge. You also need your account token if you want to run this on your account.
Put your token in the `token` value.

#### Is this dangerous to use?
Yes and no. According to the discord terms of services selfbots and modified clients are not allowed and this IS a selfbot. If you're using the api normally without abusing it, you probably wont get caught, but there's still a chance to loose your account, so do it on your own risk.
